## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).


# 01-Permutations JAVA

In this kata, your task is to create all permutations of a non-empty input string and remove duplicates, if present.

Create as many "shufflings" as you can!

Examples:


With input 'a':
Your function should return: ['a']

With input 'ab':
Your function should return ['ab', 'ba']

With input 'abc':
Your function should return ['abc','acb','bac','bca','cab','cba']

With input 'aabb':
Your function should return ['aabb', 'abab', 'abba', 'baab', 'baba', 'bbaa']
Note: The order of the permutations doesn't matter.

Good luck!



# 02-ROT13 in Java
How can you tell an extrovert from an introvert at NSA?
Va gur ryringbef, gur rkgebireg ybbxf ng gur BGURE thl'f fubrf.

I found this joke on USENET, but the punchline is scrambled. Maybe you can decipher it?
According to Wikipedia, ROT13 is frequently used to obfuscate jokes on USENET.

For this task you're only supposed to substitute characters. Not spaces, punctuation, numbers, etc.

Test examples:

"EBG13 rknzcyr." -> "ROT13 example."

"This is my first ROT13 excercise!" -> "Guvf vf zl svefg EBG13 rkprepvfr!"

# 03 - TimeFormatter

Your task in order to complete this Kata is to write a function which formats a duration, given as a number of seconds, in a human-friendly way.

The function must accept a non-negative integer. If it is zero, it just returns "now". Otherwise, the duration is expressed as a combination of years, days, hours, minutes and seconds.

It is much easier to understand with an example:

* For seconds = 62, your function should return 
    "1 minute and 2 seconds"
* For seconds = 3662, your function should return
    "1 hour, 1 minute and 2 seconds"
For the purpose of this Kata, a year is 365 days and a day is 24 hours.

Note that spaces are important.

Detailed rules
The resulting expression is made of components like 4 seconds, 1 year, etc. In general, a positive integer and one of the valid units of time, separated by a space. The unit of time is used in plural if the integer is greater than 1.

The components are separated by a comma and a space (", "). Except the last component, which is separated by " and ", just like it would be written in English.

A more significant units of time will occur before than a least significant one. Therefore, 1 second and 1 year is not correct, but 1 year and 1 second is.

Different components have different unit of times. So there is not repeated units like in 5 seconds and 1 second.

A component will not appear at all if its value happens to be zero. Hence, 1 minute and 0 seconds is not valid, but it should be just 1 minute.

A unit of time must be used "as much as possible". It means that the function should not return 61 seconds, but 1 minute and 1 second instead. Formally, the duration specified by of a component must not be greater than any valid more significant unit of time.

# 04 - Josephus Permutation

This problem takes its name by arguably the most important event in the life of the ancient historian Josephus: according to his tale, he and his 40 soldiers were trapped in a cave by the Romans during a siege.

Refusing to surrender to the enemy, they instead opted for mass suicide, with a twist: they formed a circle and proceeded to kill one man every three, until one last man was left (and that it was supposed to kill himself to end the act).

Well, Josephus and another man were the last two and, as we now know every detail of the story, you may have correctly guessed that they didn't exactly follow through the original idea.

You are now to create a function that returns a Josephus permutation, taking as parameters the initial array/list of items to be permuted as if they were in a circle and counted out every k places until none remained.

Tips and notes: it helps to start counting from 1 up to n, instead of the usual range 0..n-1; k will always be >=1.

For example, with n=7 and k=3 josephus(7,3) should act this way.

[1,2,3,4,5,6,7] - initial sequence
[1,2,4,5,6,7] => 3 is counted out and goes into the result [3]
[1,2,4,5,7] => 6 is counted out and goes into the result [3,6]
[1,4,5,7] => 2 is counted out and goes into the result [3,6,2]
[1,4,5] => 7 is counted out and goes into the result [3,6,2,7]
[1,4] => 5 is counted out and goes into the result [3,6,2,7,5]
[4] => 1 is counted out and goes into the result [3,6,2,7,5,1]
[] => 4 is counted out and goes into the result [3,6,2,7,5,1,4]
So our final result is:

josephus([1,2,3,4,5,6,7],3)==[3,6,2,7,5,1,4]

# 05 - BestTravel

John and Mary want to travel between a few towns A, B, C ... Mary has on a sheet of paper a list of distances between these towns. ls = [50, 55, 57, 58, 60]. John is tired of driving and he says to Mary that he doesn't want to drive more than t = 174 miles and he will visit only 3 towns.

Which distances, hence which towns, they will choose so that the sum of the distances is the biggest possible to please Mary and John?

Example:
With list ls and 3 towns to visit they can make a choice between: [50,55,57],[50,55,58],[50,55,60],[50,57,58],[50,57,60],[50,58,60],[55,57,58],[55,57,60],[55,58,60],[57,58,60].

The sums of distances are then: 162, 163, 165, 165, 167, 168, 170, 172, 173, 175.

The biggest possible sum taking a limit of 174 into account is then 173 and the distances of the 3 corresponding towns is [55, 58, 60].

The function chooseBestSum (or choose_best_sum or ... depending on the language) will take as parameters t (maximum sum of distances, integer >= 0), k (number of towns to visit, k >= 1) and ls (list of distances, all distances are positive or zero integers and this list has at least one element). The function returns the "best" sum ie the biggest possible sum of k distances less than or equal to the given limit t, if that sum exists, or otherwise nil, null, None, Nothing, depending on the language. In that case with C, C++, D, Dart, Fortran, F#, Go, Julia, Kotlin, Nim, OCaml, Pascal, Perl, PowerShell, Reason, Rust, Scala, Shell, Swift return -1.

Examples:
ts = [50, 55, 56, 57, 58] choose_best_sum(163, 3, ts) -> 163

xs = [50] choose_best_sum(163, 3, xs) -> nil (or null or ... or -1 (C++, C, D, Rust, Swift, Go, ...)

ys = [91, 74, 73, 85, 73, 81, 87] choose_best_sum(230, 3, ys) -> 228

Notes:
try not to modify the input list of distances ls
in some languages this "list" is in fact a string (see the Sample Tests).
